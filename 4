    /*
    This method receives a non-empty map that shows the grades of a student in various courses
    in various departments. It has department codes as keys and maps as values. Each value map
    has courses in that department as keys and corresponding grades as values. For example:

    {EECS={1001=C, 1012=A+, 1022=B}, MATH={1025=B, 1310=C, 1311=D-}, PHAS={1010=D, 2010=B}}

    We see that this student took 3 courses in EECS, 3 in MATH, and 2 in PHAS.

    The method returns a map whose keys are the various grades that the student obtained and
    whose values are the number of courses in which the student obtained that grade. For the
    above example, the method returns:

    {A+=1, B=3, C=2, D=1, D-=1}

    This is because the students obtained one A+, three B, two C, one D, and one D- in all
    courses in all departments. Note that the returned map must be sorted on its keys.
