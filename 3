    Given a non-empty list of dates, this method groups them based on the day of
    the week on which they occurred; selects the earliest one in each group; and
    return the selected ones. The return is a map whose keys are the short day of
    the week names and whose values are the selected dates. The map is sorted on
    its keys.

    For example, if list is:

    [Thu Mar 30 23:30:00 EDT 2017, Sat Dec 31 23:10:00 EST 2016, Sat Apr 01 06:00:00 EDT 2017, Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 EDT 2016, Sat Dec 31 00:15:00 EST 2016]

    then the return should be:

    {Sat=Sat Dec 31 00:15:00 EST 2016, Thu=Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 EDT 2016}
