    The method computes the sum of the infinite series:

      x / (1*1) - x / (3*3) + x / (5*5) - x / (7*7) + ...

    The terms alternate in sign and each is a fraction whose numerator is x and whose
    denominator is the square of the next odd integer starting with 1. The method keeps
    adding these terms until it  reaches a term whose absolute value is less than the
    received e parameter. At that point it returns the computed sum.

    For example, sum(10.0, 0.1) is approximately 9.21
