    Receives a non-empty string s; extracts the computing courses; and returns the sum of
    their credit counts.
         .
    A computing course is recognized by the prefix EECS or the prefix CSE (in upper or lower
    case) followed by 4 digits, followed by one or more period, followed by the credit count
    which can be optionally bracketed. The credit count is a single digit. For example, here
    are a few valid computing courses: EECS1022.3, cse4413..[4], EECS2040....[6]

    If the received string does not contains any computing course, the method returns 0.

    Example:
    totalCredit("Course EECS1022..3 and cse1020.[4] with CSE3421 or CSE6215...8") = 15
